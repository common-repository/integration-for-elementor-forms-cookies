## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why is Elementor Pro required?**

Because this integration works with the Form Widget, which is a Elementor Pro unique feature not available in the free plugin.

**Can I still use other integrations if I install this integration?**

Yes, all the other form widget integrations will be available.

**How can I use form data to set as cookie name or value?**

Be sure you are atleast on version 1.2.0. Then you can enable the switch "Use form data for cookie name" and/or "Use form data for cookie value". After that fill in the fields with the form field id you can find under the form field advanced tab.
